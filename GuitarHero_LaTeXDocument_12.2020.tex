\section{INTRODUCTION}
The game, Guitar Hero, collects information regarding the number of “hits” recorded by the player.  This poses the question about the randomness of the misses in a song and if they are correlated to the difficulty of the part of the song.

The study investigates the randomness of different songs using varying methods.  These methods looked at the number of miss streaks over the total number of misses, distances between each miss, and using the runs test.  The resampling of the data sets was performed through parametric bootstrapping, permutation tests, and regular bootstrapping. Using resampling and our methods together allowed us to assess the randomness of a given song based on the results. 

This report explains the methodology used in order to test the randomness of a song. The methods and resampling used throughout the project gave results for the empirical type 1 error and the power of the test. These methods were applied to different songs, therefore, returning different results. This report will also look at the limitations and future ideas for the project, and how some of our methods worked well while others did not.

\section{METHODOLOGY}
\subsection{Method 1}
The first method looks at the proportion of the number of miss streaks over the number of total misses.  A streak was definied as one or more misses in a row since it was easier with the code and some samples did not have that many streaks to look at.  From this method, we discovered that the proportion does not tell us anything about the location of the misses.  This proved to be difficult to determine randomness of misses without knowing the exact location of them.  

\subsection{Method 2}
The second method calculates the distances between misses in a song.  The idea behind this method was that if we can see where the misses are occurring, we can see if they are random.  We can seeing where the distances are occuring randomly and conclude that the misses must also be occurring randomly. 

There was an attempt to use a median distance as a basis rather than the mean because the distances were varied, so the average would not tell us that much.  This led to a problem because a lot of the songs had long miss streaks, which lead to a distance of 0, so the median would also become zero.  With this small issue, it led to the idea of use the runs test on this method and, therefore, the distances.
